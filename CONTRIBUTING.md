### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behaviour :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one.

When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). If you'd like, you can use [this template](#template-for-submitting-bug-reports) to structure the information.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/opencredo/opencredo-react-boilerplate/issues?q=is%3Aissue)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). [Create an issue](https://github.com/opencredo/opencredo-react-boilerplate/issues/new) and provide the following information.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started the project, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behaviour.
* **Explain which behaviour you expected to see instead and why.**
* **If the Chrome's developer tools pane is shown without you triggering it**, that normally means that an exception was thrown. The Console tab will include an entry for the exception. Expand the exception so that the stack trace is visible, and provide the full exception and stack trace in a [code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines) and as a screenshot.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Which keyboard layout are you using?** Are you using a US layout or some other layout?
